# dwm

### My suckless dwm config, simple as that really?

NOTE: You need to have fontawesome installed! If you do not have it, simply *emerge fontawesome*

slstatus is not included, see https://github.com/speediegamer/slstatus for that or edit and compile it yourself if you want.

## Installation: *git clone* into X, cd into X, and run *make clean install*

### Enjoy!
